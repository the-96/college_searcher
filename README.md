This is a test to Spring boot features. Nothing more.

1. pom.xml file:

    the recipe to build project... similar to package.json in node
2. Spring Boot gives us dependencies and configuration for our framework. NO WORK NEEDED! Production at the ready, just does nothing    
-   gives us a server in .jar file

3. Features
- easy to make starter projects
- ```spring-boot-starter-web```: web project
- ```spring-boot-starter-jdbc``` :jdbc

4. configuration
- application.properties to manually configure

5. dependency injection
- take things from different packages, put them all together.
- ex. : laptop object dependent on harddrive

6. Spring Containers
- creates object, inject into our class
- comes from configuration

7. JAR vs WAR:
- jar is the desktop application
- war is the deployment application to the server
